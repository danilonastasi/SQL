--SQL Statements
--SQL statements are very simple and straightforward like plain English but with specific syntax.


/* An SQL statement is composed of a sequence of keywords, identifiers, etc. terminated 
by a semicolon (;). Here is an example of a valid SQL statement.*/

SELECT emp_name, hire_date, salary FROM employees WHERE salary > 5000;  
-- select fields where salalry is > 5000 from table employees

-- or

SELECT emp_name, hire_date, salary 
FROM employees 
WHERE salary > 5000;

select emp_name, hire_date, salary from employees; -- it is not case-sensitive

SELECT * FROM employees;  -- select all fields from the table

/* Select all the employees whose 
salary is greater than 5000 */
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE salary > 5000;  -- condition > 5000
