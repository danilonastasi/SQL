--The AND Operator
--The AND operator is a logical operator that combines two conditions and returns TRUE 
--only if both condition evaluate to TRUE . The AND operator is often used in the WHERE 
--clause of the SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE statement to form conditions to filter the result set.

--The following SQL statement will return only those employees from the employees table 
--whose salary is greater than 7000 and the dept_id is equal to 5.
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE salary > 7000 AND dept_id = 5;


--The OR Operator
--Similarly, the OR operator is also a logical operator that combines two conditions, 
--but it returns TRUE when either of the conditions is TRUE.

--The following SQL statement will return all the employees from the employees table whose 
--salary is either greater than 7000 or the dept_id is equal to 5.
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE salary > 7000 OR dept_id = 5;


--Combining AND & OR Operator
--You can also combine AND and OR to create complex conditional expressions.

--The following SQL statement will return all the employees whose salary is 
--greater than 5000 and the dept_id is either equal to 1 or 5.
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE salary > 5000 AND (dept_id = 1 OR dept_id = 5);
