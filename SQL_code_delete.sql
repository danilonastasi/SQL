--SQL DELETE Statement
--In this tutorial you will learn how to delete records from a database table using SQL.

--Deleting Data from Tables
--Just as you insert records into a table with the INSERT statement, you can delete records from a table as well with the DELETE statement.

--Syntax
--The DELETE statement is used to remove one or more rows from a table.

DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;

--Warning: The WHERE clause in the DELETE statement specifies which record or records should 
--be deleted. It is however optional, but if you omit or forget the WHERE clause, all the 
--records will be deleted permanently from the table.


--Delete Records Based on Conditions
--The following statement will delete the rows from persons table where id is greater than 3.
DELETE FROM persons WHERE id > 3;

--Delete All Data
--Similarly, as mentioned above if you do not specify the WHERE clause in the DELETE statement 
--all the rows from the table will be deleted. However, the target table itself won't be deleted 
--that means the table structure, attributes, and indexes will remain intact.

--The following statement will remove all the records from the persons table:
DELETE FROM persons;
