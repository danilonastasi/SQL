--Select All from Table
--The following statement will return all the rows from the employees table.

SELECT * FROM employees;

-- Tip: The asterisk (*) is a wildcard character that means everything. For example, 
-- the asterisk character in the SELECT statement of the example above is a shorthand 
-- substitute for all the columns of the employees table.


-- Select Columns from Table
-- If you don't require all the data, you can select specific columns, like this:

SELECT emp_id, emp_name, hire_date, salary
FROM employees;


--SQL WHERE Clause
--In this tutorial you will learn how to select specific records from a table using SQL.

--The following SQL statement will returns all the employees from the employees table, 
--whose salary is greater than 7000. The WHERE clause simply filtered out the unwanted data.

SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE salary > 7000;

--Similarly, you can fetch records from specific columns, like this:

SELECT emp_id, emp_name, hire_date, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 7000;


--The following statement will fetch the records of an employee whose employee id is 2.

SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE emp_id = 2;
